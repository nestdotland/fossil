## fossil

An automatic registry archiving system powered by the Arweave Blockchain. This way, if our registry goes down or is compromised, nest.land can provide a permanent and immutable backup.

## What is nest.land?

Nest.land combines Deno with the [Arweave Blockchain](https://www.arweave.org/). With us, you can publish your Deno modules to the permaweb, where they can never be deleted. This avoids a major pitfall for web-based module imports while allowing the developer to maximize on the potential of Deno's import design!
